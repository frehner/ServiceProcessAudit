FIXED:
- Make process combo names show up correctly
- Figure out weird toggling (check if it's already open)
- Clean up CSS
- Change unselectable name to -- noHighlight
- Make sure that region names are normal
- If you add a new interpretation, move focus to that step
- Force selecting two items to trigger innovate
- When hitting innovation steps, make sure that you move focus to the next button/field

AREAS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION:
More Mobile friendly
Import JSON (from file/URL)
Export to a *file*
Test for PCN spec full compliance
Tooltips on touch (not just hover)
Richer display of process data (problems, etc.), particularly in the way that regions are handled (direct *with*, consider removing direct-sharing/leading, etc.)
Make it possible to innovate on a single process step (non-dual)
Add in account integration / save innovations, etc.
Make it possible to select steps to innovate via checkbox (currently only possible with touch/mouse)
Hide the random buttons in each section before it's ready to be used?
More appropriately scroll when hitting a stepEnding button (scroll to the top of the next area, not middle or bottom)
Make the combos you don't want to explore temporarily 'closeable' -- start witht hem all closed by default and expand the ones you want?
Beautiful round, button badges to show step numbers
